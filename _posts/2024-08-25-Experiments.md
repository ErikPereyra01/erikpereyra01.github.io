title: adding new posts experiment 8/25
---

_This is my experiment on how to add things to my GitHub site_. I should have gotten to these experimentations earlier, but I have to work with the time I have left. Keep trying things and seeing how things connect to one another. I think **GitHub Pages** should be the way forward, but I want to experiment and toy with some things first.
